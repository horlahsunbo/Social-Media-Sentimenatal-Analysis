# Social-Media-Sentimenatal-Analysis

In this project project, I used tweets dataset from American GOP debates. In this project, I preprocessed the dataset using NLP toolkits before fitting the processed dataset into three different supervised machine learning algorithms. I was able to reach a valid conclusion based on the results of these models. 

This project is useful for opinon modelling, customeers' feedback analysis etc.
